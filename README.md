# Smart Hearing Aid with Real-Time DSP Noise Cancellation

## Overview

This project demonstrates a smart hearing aid prototype leveraging digital signal processing (DSP) techniques for **real-time adaptive noise cancellation**. It aims to improve speech intelligibility in noisy environments using both single-microphone spectral subtraction and dual-microphone adaptive LMS filtering. The solution focuses on accessibility by using **cost-effective hardware** and open-source software tools.

## Features

- **Real-time audio capture and playback** using MATLAB Audio Toolbox
- **Adaptive noise cancellation algorithms:**
  - Spectral Subtraction (Single Mic)
  - LMS Adaptive Filtering (Dual Mic)
- **Environment mode selection:** Adjustable parameters for different acoustic settings (Room, Public Place, Outdoors) *(to be added)*
- **Delayed playback feature:** Hear filtered output with configurable delay
- **Record and save original & filtered audio for analysis**

## Motivation

Traditional hearing aids amplify all sounds, resulting in poor performance in noisy environments. Advanced digital hearing aids improve noise cancellation but are often too expensive and difficult to maintain. This project provides an affordable alternative that balances performance with accessibility.
